Lab Report: Introduction to Git and GitHub

In this lab, we explored the fundamentals of Git as a Version Control System (VCS) and learned how to use GitHub as a collaborative platform for managing repositories. The session emphasized both the technical setup of Git and the practical workflow of creating, committing, branching, and merging code changes.

We began by understanding Git’s role as a distributed version control system. Git enables developers to track changes in source code, revert to earlier versions, and collaborate seamlessly across teams. GitHub extends these capabilities by providing a web-based interface with additional tools such as pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).

The first practical step involved configuring Git with a username and email address, ensuring that all commits are properly attributed. We then created a local repository by initializing Git in a new directory and adding a simple README file. This file was staged, committed, and pushed to a newly created GitHub repository, establishing the connection between local and remote repositories.

Next, we practiced branching and collaboration. A new branch was created to add content to the README file, which was then pushed to GitHub. Using GitHub’s interface, we opened a pull request to merge the branch into the main branch. This exercise highlighted the importance of pull requests as a structured way to propose, review, and integrate changes. After merging, we updated the local repository to reflect the latest changes from GitHub.

Finally, we simulated a merge conflict by editing the same file in different branches. Resolving the conflict required manually reconciling the differences in the README file, staging the corrected version, and committing the resolution. This exercise demonstrated how Git handles conflicts and reinforced the importance of clear communication and careful review in collaborative projects.

Overall, the lab provided a comprehensive introduction to Git and GitHub. By the end, we had gained hands-on experience in setting up repositories, committing changes, collaborating through branches and pull requests, and resolving conflicts. These skills form the foundation for effective teamwork in software development, ensuring that projects remain organized, traceable, and resilient to errors.
